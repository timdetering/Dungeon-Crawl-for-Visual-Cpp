Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup
========================

Step #1: In the folder 'source/contrib' open the solution 'Contribs.sln'. Perform a 'Rebuild All' (should be about 40 warnings, and 0 errors).

Step #2: In the folder 'source' run the batch file 'execute_perl_scripts.bat'.

Step #3: In the folder 'source/MSVC' open the solution 'crawl-ref.sln'. Performa a 'Rebuild All' (will take a long time). Enjoy!

If you switch to 'Release', don't forget to go back and build the 'Contribs.sln' as 'Release' too.
